# BUS_BOOKING_APP

THE PROJECT 
A bus booking app is an online platform that allows users to search for and book bus tickets from the comfort of their own home or on the go. Here's how it typically works:

User registration: The user first needs to download the bus booking app and create an account by registering their personal information.

Search and selection: The user then searches for their desired bus route, select the travel date and time, and the number of seats they need.

Bus availability: The app will then display a list of available buses with their prices and other details such as the boarding point, dropping point, bus type, and amenities.

Seat selection: The user can then choose their preferred seats from the available ones on the selected bus.

Payment: The user then makes the payment for their booking using a secure payment gateway integrated into the app.

Confirmation: Once the payment is successful, the app will display the booking details along with the e-ticket. The user will also receive an SMS or email confirmation of their booking.

Boarding: On the day of travel, the user needs to arrive at the boarding point before the departure time and show their e-ticket to the bus staff for boarding.

In addition to booking bus tickets, some bus booking apps also provide features such as cancellation, rescheduling, live bus tracking, and customer support. The bus booking app helps users to save time, money and avoid long queues at bus stations.
